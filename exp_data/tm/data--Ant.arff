'xxx really dont like this the xml processor still too involved the processing better solution imo would create for project and target too and then process the tree and have projecttarget deal with its attributes similar with description eventually switch add support for dom things will work smoothly can avoided almost completely could still created demand for backward compatibility ',positive

'jakarta commons logging listener note not use the simplelog your logger implementation causes infinite loop since writes systemerr which ant traps and reroutes the loggerlistener layer the following names are used for the log for project events for target events for events individual targets all target and project names replace and with todo should use the advanced context logging features and expose them first todo this very inefficient switching the out and tracking the logs can optimized lot but may require few more changes the core since ant ',positive
